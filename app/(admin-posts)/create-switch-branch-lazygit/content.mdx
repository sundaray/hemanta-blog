In lazygit, creating and switching to a new branch is pretty straightforward:

- Press `n` while in the `Local branches` panel (you can navigate to it with 3 or by pressing `tab` until you're there)
- Type your branch name
- Press `return`

That's it — lazygit will create the branch and switch to it automatically.
