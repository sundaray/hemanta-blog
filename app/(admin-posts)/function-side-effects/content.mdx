A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a result. This includes, for example, the following cases:

- Modifying a variable

- Modifying a data structure in place

- Setting a field on an object

- Throwing an exception or halting with an error

- Printing to the console or reading user input

- Reading from or writing to a file

- Drawing on the screen
