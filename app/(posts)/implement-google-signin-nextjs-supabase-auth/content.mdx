If you want to integrate "Sign in with Google" in your Next.js app using Supabase Auth, you're in the right place.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a Supabase project and configure Google Cloud for OAuth
- Implement Google Sign-in in your Next.js application
- Access user information inside both client and server components
- Protect routes using middleware
- Assign roles to users using Supabase auth hooks
- Create and manage a users table in the public schema

Let's get started!

## Create a Supabase Project

- Go to supabase.com/dashboard/projects (sign in if you have an account, or create one if you don't).

- Click on **New project**.

- Give your project a name, choose a database password, select a region, and then click on **Create new project**.

- The project setup may take a minute or two to complete. Once the setup is finished, scroll down the page to find the Project API and JWT Settings sections.

  From the Project API section, copy the Project URL and API Key. From the JWT Settings section, copy the JWT Secret. Save these three values somewhere safe - we'll need them later in our setup process.

  You'll notice that the API Key is tagged with anon and public. This anon key (short for anonymous) is a public key that's safe to use in a browser, but only if you've enabled RLS (row-level security) for your tables and configured appropriate policies.

## Set up a Next.js Project

Create a Next.js project by using `create-next-app`:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest supabase-auth-nextjs-demo
```

<Note>
  Iâ€™ve named the project `supabase-auth-nextjs-demo`, but you can choose any
  name you prefer.

You can choose any **name** you prefer.

</Note>

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory.

### Install shadcn/ui:

shadcn/ui is a collection of re-usable components that we'll use in our project. To set it up, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

Follow the prompts to configure shadcn/ui according to your preferences.

We'll be using the Button, Dropdown, and Toast components. Install them with these commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dropdown-menu
npx shadcn-ui@latest add toast
```

### Install Supabase packages

We'll need the Supabase client library to interact with our Supabase backend:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr
```

### Install client-only and server-only packages

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install client-only server-only
```

These packages are useful for ensuring that certain modules are only used in their intended environment, client or server. For example, if you try to use a module marked as client-only in a server environment, you'll get an error, and vice versa.

### Install JWT decoding libraries

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install jose jwt-decode
```

These libraries are necessary to decode the JWT and access the user role. We'll be using Supabase auth hooks to add user roles inside the JWT, so we need libraries to decode them. jose is used for server-side decoding, while jwt-decode is used for client-side decoding.

### Install icon libraries

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install lucide-react react-icons
```

## Set up Supabase clients

We need to set up two different Supabase clients.

Create a new folder named `supabase` inside the `lib` folder, and inside `supabase`, create two files: `client.ts` and `server.ts`.

In `client.ts`, add the following code:

```ts title="lib/supabase/client.ts"
import "client-only";

import { createBrowserClient } from "@supabase/ssr";

export function createClient() {
  return createBrowserClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
  );
}
```

In `server.ts`, add the following code:

```ts title="lib/supabase/server.ts"
import "server-only";

import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr";

export function createClient() {
  const cookieStore = cookies();

  return createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return cookieStore.getAll();
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          try {
            cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
              cookieStore.set(name, value, options),
            );
          } catch {
            // The `setAll` method was called from a Server Component.
            // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing
            // user sessions.
          }
        },
      },
    },
  );
}
```

You might be wondering why we need two separate clients for Supabase Auth. The reason is that we use different methods to access Supabase depending on where we're making the call:

- The `createClient` function in `client.ts` is used to access Supabase inside client components.
- The `createClient` function in `server.ts` is used to access Supabase inside server components, server actions, and route handlers.
