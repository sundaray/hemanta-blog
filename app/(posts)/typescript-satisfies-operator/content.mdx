The `satisfies` operator lets you **validate** that a variable **conforms to a minimum contract** (a type) while still **preserving its own specific, inferred shape**.

Let's walk through an example.

Below we have a `Person` type, and we've annotated the `jim` variable with that `Person` type.

```ts {10} twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address?: {
    street: string;
    postcode?: string;
  };
};

const jim: Person = {
  name: "Jim",
  age: 43,
};
```

If you hover over `jim` in your editor, you will see its type has been "widened" to match the `Person` type:

```ts title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
const jim: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address?:
    | {
        street: string;
        postcode?: string | undefined;
      }
    | undefined;
};
```

Notice that the inferred type contains an optional `address` property, even though our `jim` object doesn't have an `address` field. TypeScript has "forgotten" the specific shape of our object and only remembers the `Person` contract.

How can we make TypeScript ensure `jim` conforms to the `Person` shape, yet not widen the type to include the `address` field?

We can use the `satisfies` operator.

```ts {13} twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address?: {
    street: string;
    postcode?: string;
  };
};

const jim = {
  //   ^?
  name: "Jim",
  age: 43,
} satisfies Person;
```

Now, see that the type of `jim` is just its own shape.

On one hand, TypeScript still checks that `{ name: "Jim", age: 43 }` is a valid `Person`. If we misspelled `name` or made `age` a string, it would throw an error. On the other hand, the `jim` variable keeps its narrow, inferred type. TypeScript knows for a fact it only has `name` and `age`.

As you saw, the `satisfies` operator is one of the key mechanisms TypeScript offers to control type widening, giving you both type safety and type precision.
