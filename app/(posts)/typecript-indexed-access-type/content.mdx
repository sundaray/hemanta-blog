An **indexed access type** (also called a "lookup type") lets you query the type of a property from another type.

To query the type, you use square brackets `[]` (called an **indexed access operator**), which works just like accessing a property on a JavaScript object, but it's done at the type level.

Let's see it in action.

## Accessing a Single Property's Type

Below, we have a `userPermissions` object, where the keys are the user roles and the values are the specific permissions for that role. We use `as const` to tell TypeScript to infer the most specific type. This treats each string as a literal type (e.g., `"create-post"`) instead of just string, and each array as a readonly tuple.

From the `userPermissions` object, we use the `typeof` operator to create the `UserPermissions` type. This is the type we will be querying in the following examples.

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
const userPermissions = {
  admin: [
    "create-post",
    "edit-post",
    "Delete-post",
    "view-posts",
    "add-comment",
  ],
  editor: ["create-post", "edit-post", "view-posts"],
  viewer: ["view-posts", "add-comment"],
} as const;

type UserPermissions = typeof userPermissions;
```

Let's say we want to find out the type for just the admin's permissions. We can access it using the string `'admin'` as the index:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
const userPermissions = {
  admin: [
    "create-post",
    "edit-post",
    "Delete-post",
    "view-posts",
    "add-comment",
  ],
  editor: ["create-post", "edit-post", "view-posts"],
  viewer: ["view-posts", "add-comment"],
} as const;

type UserPermissions = typeof userPermissions;
// ---cut---
type AdminPermissions = UserPermissions["admin"];
```

## Accessing Multiple Types with a Union

Now, what if we need to find out the types for two specific roles? We can pass a union of keys into the brackets to get a union of their value types.

Let's get a type that could be the permissions for either an `editor` or a `viewer`:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
const userPermissions = {
  admin: [
    "create-post",
    "edit-post",
    "Delete-post",
    "view-posts",
    "add-comment",
  ],
  editor: ["create-post", "edit-post", "view-posts"],
  viewer: ["view-posts", "add-comment"],
} as const;

type UserPermissions = typeof userPermissions;
// ---cut---
type EditorOrViewerPermissions = UserPermissions["editor" | "viewer"];
```

## The Special `number` Syntax

When you use `number` as an index on an array/tuple type, TypeScript understands this to mean "the type of any element at any numeric index," which results in a union of all the element types.

Let's say we want to find **the type for all permissions combined, from all roles**.

We can do this in two steps:

### 1. Get a union of all permission arrays.

We can use `keyof` to get all the keys from `UserPermissions` and use that as the index:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
const userPermissions = {
  admin: [
    "create-post",
    "edit-post",
    "Delete-post",
    "view-posts",
    "add-comment",
  ],
  editor: ["create-post", "edit-post", "view-posts"],
  viewer: ["view-posts", "add-comment"],
} as const;

type UserPermissions = typeof userPermissions;
// ---cut---
type AllPermissionArrays = UserPermissions[keyof UserPermissions];
```

### 2. Use number to get the element types from that union.

Now we can apply the `number` operator to this new `AllPermissionArrays` type. This tells TypeScript to look inside each tuple in the union and pull out all of their element types into one, flat union:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
const userPermissions = {
  admin: [
    "create-post",
    "edit-post",
    "Delete-post",
    "view-posts",
    "add-comment",
  ],
  editor: ["create-post", "edit-post", "view-posts"],
  viewer: ["view-posts", "add-comment"],
} as const;

type UserPermissions = typeof userPermissions;
type AllPermissionArrays = UserPermissions[keyof UserPermissions];
// ---cut---
type AllPermission = AllPermissionArrays[number];
```

The final `AllPermission` type is a single union of every possible permission string from the `UserPermissions` object. Notice that TypeScript automatically handles deduplication when building this union. The type itself only cares about the possible set of values, not how many times they appeared
