Record is **a built-in utility type** in TypeScript. It’s a shorthand for creating an object type where the keys come from a specific set (Keys) and all the values are of the same type (Value).

## Syntax

It’s syntax is: `Record<Keys, Type>`:

- `Keys`: This is typically a union of string literals (e.g., `"admin" | "editor" | "viewer"`).
- `Type`: This is the type every value in the object must have. (e.g., `string`, `boolean` or a more complex `{permissionLevel: number}`)

## Key Benefit

**The key benefit of `Record` is it keeps related values and types synchronized.**

Let's see this in action.

Below, we have a `UserRole` type and an object called `roleDescriptions` that maps each role to a description.

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
type UserRole = "admin" | "editor" | "viewer";

const roleDescriptions: Record<UserRole, { description: string }> = {
  admin: { description: "Can access and modify everything." },
  editor: { description: "Can create and edit content." },
  viewer: { description: "Can only view content." },
};
```

Because of `Record`, there is a contract between the `UserRole` type and the `roleDescriptions` object. In other words, the object is now required to have a key for every member of the `UserRole` type.

Let's see what happens when we try to break this contract.

Imagine a new requirement comes in for a `guest` role. We update the `UserRole` type but forget to update our object. TypeScript immediately throws an error on the `roleDescriptions` object:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
// @errors: 2741
type UserRole = "admin" | "editor" | "viewer" | "guest";
//                                               ^^^^^
const roleDescriptions: Record<UserRole, { description: string }> = {
  admin: { description: "Can access and modify everything." },
  editor: { description: "Can create and edit content." },
  viewer: { description: "Can only view content." },
};
```

This error tells us, "Hey, your source of truth (`UserRole`) changed. You must update this object to match it." It forces synchronization and prevents the bug before it ever happens.
