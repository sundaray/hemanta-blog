A mapped type transforms an existing type into a new one by applying a specific rule to each property within the original type.

## Mapped Type Syntax

The basic syntax follows this pattern:

```ts title="TypeScript"
type MappedType<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

`P` is a type variable that represents each key of `T` during the mapping process. The `in` keyword iterates over the union of keys produced by `keyof T`. So, `P in keyof T` means "for each property name `P` in the union of keys from type `T`..."

## Mapped Type Example

Let’s create a generic `FormErrors` type that takes any form type `T` and converts its properties into optional strings.

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript"
const userForm = {
  username: "john",
  email: "john@gmail.com",
  age: 24,
};

type UserForm = typeof userForm;

type FormErrors<T> = {
  // `?` makes the new property optional.
  [K in keyof T]?: string;
};

type UserFormErrors = FormErrors<UserForm>;
//   ^?
```

Notice what happened to the `age` property. Even though `age` was a number in the original `UserForm` type, our mapped type correctly transformed it into `string | undefined`.

## Modifying Keys with the as Clause

Let's look at the basic syntax of mapped types once again:

```ts title="TypeScript"
type MappedType<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

In this pattern, we iterate through each key `P` in keyof `T` and use that **exact same key** `P` for the new type.

But what if we want to change the key `P` into something else?

This is where the `as` clause comes in. It allows you to "remap" the original key to a new one. The syntax with `as` looks like this:

```ts title="TypeScript"
type MappedTypeWithRemapping<T> = {
  // P is the original key
  // NewKeyType is the key you want in the new type
  [P in keyof T as NewKeyType]: T[P];
};
```

The `as` clause is evaluated for each key in the original type. You can use conditional types, template literal types, and other type-level logic to decide what the `NewKeyType` should be.

Let's go through a few examples.

### Renaming keys (e.g., adding a prefix)

This is a common use case. Let's say you want to create a new type where all property keys are prefixed with `on`.

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript"
type Events = {
  click: (x: number, y: number) => void;
  scroll: (pos: number) => void;
};

type EventListeners<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as `on${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: T[K];
};

type OnClickListeners = EventListeners<Events>;
//   ^?
```

We use template literal types inside the `as` clause.

<Note>
  `string & K` is a good practice to ensure `K` is treated as a string so it can
  be used in a template literal.
</Note>

### Filtering keys (by remapping to never)

This is the standard pattern for filtering in mapped types. If you remap a key as `never`, TypeScript simply discards that property from the resulting type.

Let's create a type that only keeps properties whose values are string.

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript"
type MixedData = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
};
type StringPropertiesOnly<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as T[K] extends string ? K : never]: T[K];
};

type StringData = StringPropertiesOnly<MixedData>;
//   ^?
```

Here we use a conditional type in the `as` clause.

### Case conversion (snake case to camel case)

Often, an API or database will return keys in snake_case, but our JavaScript/TypeScript code prefers camelCase. We can use the `as` clause to perform this transformation automatically.

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript"
type SnakeToCamel<S extends string> = S extends `${infer P1}_${infer P2}`
  ? `${Lowercase<P1>}${Capitalize<Lowercase<P2>>}`
  : S;

type DbUser = {
  user_id: number;
  first_name: string;
  last_login: Date;
};

type AppUser = {
  [K in keyof DbUser as SnakeToCamel<string & K>]: DbUser[K];
};

function convertDbUserToAppUser(dbUser: DbUser) {
  return {
    userId: dbUser.user_id,
    firstName: dbUser.first_name,
    lastLogin: dbUser.last_login,
  };
}

const dbData: DbUser = {
  user_id: 101,
  first_name: "Jane",
  last_login: new Date(),
};

const appUser = convertDbUserToAppUser(dbData);
//    ^?
```

## Mapped Types Modifiers

Mapped types support modifiers that provide fine-grained control over property characteristics. The two primary mapped type modifiers are:

1. `readonly`: Makes properties immutable (read-only)
2. `?`: Makes properties optional

We can add and remove these modifiers using prefix operators:

- `+`: Explicitly adds a modifier (this is the default behavior)
- `-`: Removes an existing modifier

Let's look at two examples.

### Making all properties required (removing ?)

Let's say you have a type where all properties are optional, and you want to create a new type where all properties are required.

We can create a generic `MakeRequired<T>` utility type:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript"
type MakeRequired<T> = {
  // We use '-?' to remove the optional modifier
  [K in keyof T]-?: T[K];
};

type PartialConfig = {
  apiUrl?: string;
  timeout?: number;
  apiKey?: string;
};

type CompleteConfig = MakeRequired<PartialConfig>;
//   ^?
```

Here, we use the `-?` modifier to remove the optional (?) marker from each property. This is exactly how TypeScript's built-in `Required<T>` utility type works.

### Making properties writable (removing readonly)

Conversely, you might have a read-only object and need to create a "writable" version of it.

We can create a generic `MakeMutable<T>` utility type:

```ts twoslash title="TypeScript"
type MakeMutable<T> = {
  // We use '-readonly' to remove the readonly modifier
  -readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];
};

type LockedData = {
  readonly id: number;
  readonly name: string;
};

type UnlockedData = MakeMutable<LockedData>;
//   ^?
```

By using `-readonly`, we've created a new `UnlockedData` type where all properties are mutable (writable).
