Exhaustiveness checking in TypeScript is a technique to ensure you've handled all possible cases in union types or discriminated unions.

The most common place to use exhaustiveness check is within a `switch` statement or a series of `if...else if` blocks.

The pattern is simple: after you think you've handled every possible case, you add a `default` case (or final `else` block). Inside that block, you pass the variable to a helper function that accepts an argument of type `never` and throws an error.

This forces the compiler to prove that every case was handled. If you miss a case, the variable's type won't be `never`, and you'll get a compile-time error.

Letâ€™s understand this using an example.

Below, we have a discriminated union type `ApiState`, an `assertUnreachable` helper function, and a `displayData` function that intentionally misses one of the cases:

```ts {6-8} twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
// @errors: 2345
type ApiState<T> =
  | { status: "loading" }
  | { status: "success"; data: T }
  | { status: "error"; error: Error };

function assertUnreachable(x: never): never {
  throw new Error(`Unhandled state: ${JSON.stringify(x)}`);
}

type User = { id: number; name: string };

function displayData(state: ApiState<User>): string {
  switch (state.status) {
    case "loading":
      return "Loading user...";

    case "success":
      return `Welcome, ${state.data.name}!`;

    default:
      return assertUnreachable(state);
  }
}
```

Notice how we get a compile-time error. The TypeScript compiler reminds us that we have forgotten to handle the `error` case.

Inside the `default` block, TypeScript correctly narrows the type of state to `{ status: "error"; error: Error }`. Since this type is not `never`, passing it to our `assertUnreachable` function (which only accepts `never`) fails, triggering the error.

This is extremely useful and prevents runtime errors from unhandled cases
