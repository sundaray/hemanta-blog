Let's say you're building a library with a function that calculates shipping costs:

```ts {1-4} twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
// This function calculates the shipping cost based on weight and distance
// weight is in kilograms
// distance is in kilometers
// Returns the cost in dollars
function calculateShipping(weight: number, distance: number): number {
  const baseRate = 5.0;
  const perKgRate = 0.5;
  const perKmRate = 0.1;

  return baseRate + weight * perKgRate + distance * perKmRate;
}
```

You've left a comment describing what the function does. But when a user of your library imports and tries to use this function, they don't see your helpful comments. Hovering over the function name just shows them the function signature, like this:

The reason users don't see the comments is because regular comments get stripped away during compilation.

So, is there a way to ensure the comments visible to us are also visible to users in their code editor?

Yes, there is. The solution is to use **JSDoc-formatted comments**.

## JSDoc-Formatted Comments

[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) (and its TypeScript-flavored variant, [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/)) is a documentation standard that uses specially formatted comments. These comments start with `/**` (note the double asterisk) instead of the regular `//`, and they follow a specific structure that code editors can understand.

When you write JSDoc comments, your editor surfaces that documentation directly in autocomplete tooltips and on-hover information. Your users get rich, inline help without ever leaving their current file.

Let's rewrite the `calculateShipping` function with JSDoc:

```ts {1-8} twoslash title="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
/**
 * Calculates shipping cost based on package weight and delivery distance.
 *
 * @param weight - The package weight in kilograms
 * @param distance - The delivery distance in kilometers
 * @returns The shipping cost in US dollars
 *
 */
function calculateShipping(weight: number, distance: number): number {
  const baseRate = 5.0;
  const perKgRate = 0.5;
  const perKmRate = 0.1;

  return baseRate + weight * perKgRate + distance * perKmRate;
}
```

Now, when someone hovers over `calculateShipping` anywhere in their codebase, they see the full description:

They have all the context they need, right where they need it.

## The JSDoc Format Breakdown

A JSDoc comment typically has three parts:

- **The opening delimiter**: /\*\* (a slash followed by two asterisks).

- **The description**: A brief summary of what the function, class, or type does.

- **Block tags**: Special annotations starting with `@` that describe specific parts of the API.

Common tags you'll use all the time:

- **@param**: Describes a function parameter
- **@returns**: Describes what the function returns
- **@example**: Shows usage examples
- **@throws**: Documents what errors might be thrown
- **@deprecated**: Marks something as deprecated with migration guidance

## Conclusion

Here's the simplest way to think about it:

- Regular comments are for the implementer (you, reading your own source code).

- JSDoc comments are for the consumer (everyone using your code).

If you intend for someone else to import and use your code, you should add a JSDoc comment. It's a small effort that dramatically improves the developer experience for everyone who uses your code.
